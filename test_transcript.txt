Speaker: Welcome everyone to today's talk about Docker containerization best practices.

Let me start by explaining what Docker is. Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package your applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.

The key benefits of Docker include:
- Consistency across environments
- Faster deployment times
- Better resource utilization
- Simplified scaling

Now, let's talk about some best practices:

1. Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size
2. Don't run containers as root user
3. Use .dockerignore files to exclude unnecessary files
4. Keep your images small by using alpine base images
5. Use specific version tags instead of 'latest'

Here's an example of a good Dockerfile:

FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
USER node
CMD ["npm", "start"]

This Dockerfile follows several best practices - it uses a specific version tag, sets a working directory, copies package files first for better caching, and runs as a non-root user.

Another important aspect is container orchestration. While Docker Compose is great for development, for production you should consider Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

Security is also crucial. Always scan your images for vulnerabilities, use secrets management, and keep your base images updated.

That concludes today's overview of Docker best practices. Thank you for your attention.
